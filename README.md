Voice Controlled Home Automation Using Arduino is an exciting project that aims to automate home appliances with the power of voice commands. In this project, voice instructions will be recognised, and text-to-speech conversion will be performed using an Android app. The HC-05 module will then be used to transmit the text data via Bluetooth to an Arduino microcontroller. This system is very practical and user-friendly because it enables users to simply control and manage home appliances using basic voice commands. This idea offers a new degree of automation and efficiency in managing home appliances thanks to the integration of modern technology.
