Are you tired of constantly monitoring your plants' water needs or worried about leaving them unattended while you're away? Today we are going to make a simple yet effective project for that. In this project we will constantly monitor the soil moisture level using a capacitive sensor. When the moisture level goes below a certain level, the microcontroller will turn on the pump and water the plants.

Note: As this projects are very simple we are only providing the code, schemaitic, and a few essential images if you want to get the images or code explanations do check out the Circuit Digest website.
